# Shakes & Fidget scrapbook extension
A Chrome scrapbook helper extension for Shakes & Fidget. Useful if you don't have the holy grail yet.

It works purely by scanning http requests, making it virtually undetectable.

**Adapted to the new game backend. Works on new servers (i.e. Europe w5)**

## How to use
1. Install the extension.
1. Open your scrapbook so the tool can scan it.
1. Browse players in hall of fame and the tool will show you how many of their items you're missing. 
Note that you will have to wait a while before scanning the same player repeatedly as SFGame seems to cache the inventories.
